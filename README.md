#### Postgres

This server requires that you have Postgres installed and running on the default Postgres port of 5432. It requires that you have a database created on the server with the name of `postgres`
- Your username should be `postgres`
- Your password should be `root`

## Testing

1. Check that the test/java folder is marked as the Test Sources Root, if it is, it should be lit green. If the test/java folder does not appear to be marked as the Test Sources Root, right click on the folder and click Mark Directory as -> Test Sources Root.
2. Open the ServiceImplTest class of your choice to see the available unit tests.
3. Select the test you want to run and left click on the green arrow appearing to the left of the test name in order to run the test. Alternatively right click on the test name and choose "run" from a drop down list.
4. If you want to **run the test with coverage**, right click on the green arrow and choose "Run ... with coverage" from the options on a drop down list. Alternatively right click on the test name and choose "More run/debug" from a drop down list; this will produce a second drop downlist;  select "Run... with coverage". 
You can use this same process to run all the tests within the class with coverage if you use the the green arrow to the left of the class name or right click on the class name. This will tell you what percentage of the classes, methods, and lines are covered by the testing units.
5. After following step 3 or 4, dialogue should appear which will indicate whether the test passed or failed. If the test failed the dialogue should provide a comparison between the expected results and the failed results.
6. To run all of the tests at once, use the green arrow button which is found to the left of the testing class name. Alternatively right click on the class name and choose "run" from a drop down list.
